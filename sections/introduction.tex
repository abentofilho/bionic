\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
	We present the sixteen-degree-of-freedom four-legged robot Guar\'a. Biologically inspired navigation and balance strategies were implemented through an incremental algorithm for running straight and curved paths which allows the robot to be driven on the fly, keeping it balanced. We used walking pattern matrices in statically stable walking for leg's movements coupling to run the real robot. An integrated environment was provided for walking simulation, robot's parameters adjustment and diagnosis of operation. Straight and curved path  walking results are presented, focusing on leg's kinematics and robot's stability concerns. The results show a good general performance, which encourages robot's use as a four legged research platform for indoor and outdoor applications with dynamically stable walking.
